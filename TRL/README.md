### **TRL Levels Explained (Middle Section)**

1. **TRL 1 - Basic principles observed and reported**:
   - This level involves scientific research that leads to new discoveries.
   - Basic technological concepts are observed, but their applications are not yet clear.
   - The goal at this level is scientific exploration and understanding.

2. **TRL 2 - Technology concept and application formulated**:
   - At this stage, the concept is further developed, and applications are identified.
   - Invention begins, and practical applications of the technology are proposed.
   - Scientific investigations confirm the idea, but no experimental proof is available.
   - Initial experiments support the hypothesis or theoretical concept.

3. **TRL 3 - Analytical and experimental proof of concept**:
   - This level involves the demonstration of the technology in a laboratory setting.
   - Critical functions and characteristics are analyzed, and experimental studies are conducted.
   - There are laboratory demonstrations or simulations that validate key components or proof of concept.
   - This phase marks the beginning of practical validation with structured studies.

The notes provide details on **Technology Readiness Levels (TRL)** 4, 5, and 6, focusing on hardware (H/W) and software (S/W) development and the exit criteria for each level. Here's a summary of the content:

### **TRL 4 - Component or Breadboard Validation in a Laboratory Environment**

These notes focus on **incremental validation** of hardware and software components, with clear exit criteria that determine readiness to advance to higher TRL stages. Each level ensures greater fidelity and alignment with the final operational environment, progressively reducing technical uncertainty.

The notes in this image outline **Technology Readiness Levels (TRL)** 7, 8, and 9, focusing on system demonstrations, actual operations, and exit criteria. Here's a summary:

### **TRL 7 - System Prototype Demonstration in an Operational Environment**
- **Definition**: 
  - A **high-fidelity engineering unit** that addresses critical issues is built and operated in an actual operational environment (e.g., ground, airborne, or space).
  
- **Hardware (H/W)**: 
  - A prototype that meets all key functional requirements is built and tested in the operational environment. The system demonstrates performance in realistic scenarios.
  
- **Software (S/W)**: 
  - The software is integrated and fully functional within the system. It is tested under operational conditions with the hardware to demonstrate performance.
  
- **Exit Criteria**: 
  - Documented test results that align with analytical predictions, proving that the system can operate in a real environment.
