### **Innovation Portfolio Architecture**
- The **innovation portfolio** is described as a **positive feedback, open-loop system** for evolving and discovering new ideas and products.
- A process is outlined where different **concepts** move through stages of **materialization** and **testing** before reaching final approval.
  
### **Objective of the Innovation Process**
- The objective is to:
  1. **Examine 100 new ideas** for products and services each quarter.
  2. **Select the 10 best ideas** from the initial pool.
  3. **Develop teams** and **prototype products** for real-world trials based on the selected ideas.

### **Data Fragmentation and Ideation**
- The largest source of ideas comes from **data fragmentation** and **web-based ideation platforms**.
- Ideas are grouped into **clusters** to form a **focused concept** for development.

### **Thresholds for Innovation**
- There is an emphasis on moving ideas as quickly as possible through a **filtering system** that rejects non-viable concepts.
- Ideas are **partially researched** before moving forward, ensuring they meet basic requirements.

### **Fast and Frugal Decision Tree (FFDT)**
- The **Fast and Frugal Decision Tree** (FFDT) is mentioned as a method for **quick decision-making**.
- The FFDT ensures that ideas meet a minimum quality threshold, suggesting which concepts deserve further attention.

These notes describe a **systematic approach** to managing an innovation portfolio, where a large number of ideas are filtered down through structured evaluations, resulting in a handful of promising prototypes. The **Fast and Frugal Decision Tree** is key to quickly narrowing down the best ideas for further development.

The notes describe a structured approach to **concept screening and evaluation** within an innovation portfolio, using qualitative and quantitative methods. Here's a summary:

### **Phase 1: Early Screening (Qualitative)**
- The objective is to determine whether an idea can **attain strategic value** and **success** within the organization.
- **Key questions** include:
  - Is the **overall value** of the concept sufficient to justify further investment?
  - Do the concept’s **resources, competitive advantage, and IP position** align with strategic objectives?

- **Strategic alignment** is important at this stage, but detailed strategic evaluation is not required yet.
  
### **Phase 2: Understanding Big Value Proposition (Quantitative)**
- Focuses on understanding the **big value proposition** of a concept, both conceptually and quantitatively.
- This phase involves analyzing the **Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM)** for:
  - **Revenue margin**
  - **Launch cost**
  
- The ROM helps to estimate the potential of a concept in terms of financial performance.

### **Decision-Making Framework**
- A decision flowchart evaluates whether the concept should be promoted to the innovation portfolio:
  1. **Is the concept consistent with portfolio strategy?**
  2. **Is there a clear statement of how the concept delivers value to customers?**
  3. **Is the concept champion able to deliver on project goals?**
  
  If the answers are positive, the concept is promoted to the portfolio. Otherwise, it is rejected.

### **ROM (Rough Order of Magnitude) Analysis**
- ROM analysis evaluates **financial projections** using three scenarios:
  1. **Optimistic**
  2. **Most likely**
  3. **Pessimistic**

- These scenarios are used to calculate potential **revenue margins** and **launch costs** under different conditions.
  
### **Bucket Value Replacement**
- The ROM scenarios are associated with a **bucket value replacement model**:
  - The **most likely scenario** is used to assess an attribute, and the bounding values are associated with a **technology readiness scale**.

The notes outline a clear framework for screening and promoting concepts based on their strategic value, alignment, and financial potential, utilizing both qualitative assessments and quantitative ROM analysis. The focus is on making informed decisions about whether to include concepts in the innovation portfolio based on these evaluations.

The notes provide a detailed framework for evaluating concepts through a **Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) Estimate** and focus on six quantitative attributes for assessing innovation programs. Here's a summary:

### **Phase 2: ROM Estimate and Range Values**
- This phase involves estimating the **range values** of various attributes to understand the uncertainty and readiness of a project.
  
### **Six Quantitative Attributes**
1. **Net Benefits of the Program**:
   - Focuses on **operating profit** and overall financial gain.
   
2. **Program Costs**:
   - Estimating the total **launch cost**.

3. **Timeline for Readiness**:
   - **Launch year** and when the program will be ready for implementation.

4. **Maturity and Uncertainty of the Technology**:
   - Using the **Technology Readiness Level (TRL)** to assess uncertainty and maturity of the technology involved.

5. **Related Benefits**:
   - Evaluating **platform synergy** and additional benefits beyond the initial objectives.

6. **Development Costs**:
   - Estimating the **initial investment** for development and implementation.

### **Concept Grouping and Prioritization**
- Concepts are grouped based on **short-term vs. long-term impact**, and high vs. low potential for **marketplace impact**.
- There’s a focus on concepts that can **reduce risk** and provide **CEO guarantees**.

### **Concept Evaluation Phases**
- **Phase 0 (Ideation)**: Qualitative assessment of around **80 concepts**.
- **Phase 1**: ROM assessment of **40 concepts**.
- **Phase 2**: Scenario analysis for **20 concepts**, exploring various financial and risk factors.
- **Phase 3**: In-depth cost and risk management analysis for **10 concepts**.

Each phase filters and reduces the number of concepts, focusing on the ones with the most potential for success.

### **Business Case Development**
- **Phase 4** (not included in the table): After Phase 3, **business cases** are prepared for the final selected concepts, with detailed development plans.

The notes present a structured process for evaluating and narrowing down potential concepts for development, moving from qualitative assessments to detailed financial and risk analysis. The emphasis is on using the **ROM** to estimate costs, benefits, and readiness, ensuring only the most promising concepts move forward.
