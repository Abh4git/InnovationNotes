[Innovation Portfolio Architecture](https://github.com/Abh4git/InnovationNotes/blob/main/InnovationPortfolioArchitecture/innovation_portfolio_arch.PNG)
### **Innovation Portfolio Architecture**
- The **innovation portfolio** is described as a **positive feedback, open-loop system** for evolving and discovering new ideas and products.
- A process is outlined where different **concepts** move through stages of **materialization** and **testing** before reaching final approval.
  
### **Objective of the Innovation Process**
- The objective is to:
  1. **Examine 100 new ideas** for products and services each quarter.
  2. **Select the 10 best ideas** from the initial pool.
  3. **Develop teams** and **prototype products** for real-world trials based on the selected ideas.

### **Data Fragmentation and Ideation**
- The largest source of ideas comes from **data fragmentation** and **web-based ideation platforms**.
- Ideas are grouped into **clusters** to form a **focused concept** for development.

### **Thresholds for Innovation**
- There is an emphasis on moving ideas as quickly as possible through a **filtering system** that rejects non-viable concepts.
- Ideas are **partially researched** before moving forward, ensuring they meet basic requirements.

### **Fast and Frugal Decision Tree (FFDT)**
- The **Fast and Frugal Decision Tree** (FFDT) is mentioned as a method for **quick decision-making**.
- The FFDT ensures that ideas meet a minimum quality threshold, suggesting which concepts deserve further attention.

These notes describe a **systematic approach** to managing an innovation portfolio, where a large number of ideas are filtered down through structured evaluations, resulting in a handful of promising prototypes. The **Fast and Frugal Decision Tree** is key to quickly narrowing down the best ideas for further development.
