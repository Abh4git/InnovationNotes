#Innovation Clover
The notes in the image describe an "Innovation Clover" framework and a structured process for innovation, which seems focused on identifying customer needs, creating value propositions, and developing novel concepts. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the content:

### **Innovation Clover (Top Diagram)**:
This is a Venn diagram with four overlapping circles representing different considerations in the innovation process:
- **Technologically feasible**
- **Within strategic capabilities**
- **Financially worthwhile**
- **Fulfills customer needs and provides value**

The overlap of these considerations represents an ideal innovation space where new ideas should be developed.

---

### **A) Start a Strategic Question**:
- The first step is to start with a strategic question.
- **Degree or boundaries**: Define the areas to explore for opportunities.
- Match the company’s **capacity** and **interest** with opportunities.

---

### **B) Invent New Customer Needs**:
- Clearly define customer needs.
- Discover **new ways** that could **radically change** how customers’ needs are met.

---

### **C) Tool & Refine the Value Proposition**:
- Create and **test** the value proposition with **real products** and **real customer settings**.

---

### **Strategic Question**:
- **Collaboration between business and R&D**: Define a strategic medium.
- **Organizations need to bring customers in modularly**.
- **Orient towards the customer and larger opportunities**.
- The **opportunity space** lies in the intersection between business and R&D.

---

### **D) Focus on Understanding Customer Needs**:
- Focus on understanding what the **customer needs/wants**.
- Without truly understanding customer needs, **there is no business**.
- **Focus on compelling customer needs** and **novel ways** of satisfying them.

---

### **E) Create New Value Propositions**:
- The new value proposition should go beyond the product or service.
- It should encompass all aspects of new value creation.

---

### **F) PASTA Framework**:
- **PASTA** framework is mentioned (though not fully detailed in the image).
- Appears to guide the process of clarifying customer needs, identifying opportunity space, and strategic questioning.

---

### **Process Overview**:
- The innovation process seems to follow these steps:
  1. **Strategic question**
  2. **Customer needs**
  3. **Novel concept**
  4. **Value propositions**
  5. **Customer trials**
  6. **Product development**

---

The notes emphasize a **customer-centric innovation process** where customer needs drive the strategic direction, novel ideas, value creation, and the eventual development of new products or services.
