# Innovation Notes
![Innovation=Invention+Commercialization](https://github.com/Abh4git/InnovationNotes/blob/main/innovation.PNG) Innovation = Invention + Commercialization.   
Innovation in detail is discussed in the presentation. [Innovation, Perspectives, Steps and Strategies.](https://github.com/Abh4git/InnovationNotes/blob/main/Definitions/Innovation_Perspectives_Steps_Strategies.pdf)   
Further we discuss Innovation methods : [Innovation Portfolio Architecture](https://github.com/Abh4git/InnovationNotes/blob/main/InnovationPortfolioArchitecture/README.md),
[Design Thinking](https://github.com/Abh4git/InnovationNotes/blob/main/DesignThinking/2017-05-DesignThinkingExternal.pdf) and [Innovation Clover](https://github.com/Abh4git/InnovationNotes/blob/main/InnovationClover/README.md).
Each of these approaches have unique value proposition. An organization looking at long term of product and system should be considering a Portfolio approach which is more holistic in nature. Design Thinking is an approach to invent into user needs and empathize with customers driven by experiences. Innovation Clover focuses on Innovation as management of constraints, like inventing into customer needs and also looking at alignment to organizational strategies. NASA [Technology Readiness Levels (TRL)](https://github.com/Abh4git/InnovationNotes/blob/main/TRL/README.md) often provides guidance to technology maturity.

A standardized approach to [Innovation Innovation Management (ISO 56001:2024)](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:56001:ed-1:v1:en) is as well available.
